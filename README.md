Social Fragmentation Index

Derived from a method included in;
Congdon, Peter (2013) Assessing the Impact of Socioeconomic Variables on Small Area Variations in Suicide Outcomes in England. Int J Environ Res Public Health. 10(1): 158–177. 

The model uses neighbourhood level census data in the UK.
Standard scores are calculated for the below metrics for each ‘neighbourhood’ area, added together and a final ‘Social Fragmentation Index’ (z score) is calculated.
All metrics are weighted equally. The direction of the final scores is;  more ‘socially fragmented’ = higher scores, less ‘socially fragmented' = lower scores.

This may be considered a proxy for social cohesion and sense of attachment to resident neighbourhoods in which people live.

Results in 2011 include a small error: the denominator used for some input metrics only includes those aged 16 or over, so the index is more representative of the ‘adult’ population.
